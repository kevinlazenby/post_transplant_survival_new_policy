# An updated estimate of posttransplant survival after implementation of the new donor heart allocation policy

This repository contains all code used to perform analyses and generate results for the manuscript "An updated estimate of posttransplant survival after implementation of the new donor heart allocation policy," published in the American Journal of Transplantation and accessible online [here](https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16931).

Description of each script:


- function_definitions.Rmd: Run this script first. It defines functions that are used throughout the rest of the code.


- data_wrangling.Rmd: Run this script second. It imports the data and prepares it for analysis.


- kaplan_meier_model.Rmd: Generates Figure 1.


- survival_by_treatment_type.Rmd: Generates Figure 3 and Figure S2.


- recipient_characteristics.Rmd: Generates Table 1 and Table S2.


- truncated_follow_up_demonstration.Rmd: Generates Figure 2.


- data_visualization.Rmd: Generates certain results reported in the manuscript.


- survival_probability_demonstration.Rmd: Generates Figure S1.


- cox_ph_model.Rmd: Generates Table S1 and Table S3.
